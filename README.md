Create a mobile travel app that helps users discover and plan their trips. The app should include features like browsing destinations,
viewing points of interest, and organizing itineraries. Users can save favorite places and get information about local attractions, accommodations, 
and transportation options. This project will involve UI design, API integration for travel information, and basic user interaction.
